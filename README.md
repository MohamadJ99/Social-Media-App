```

The frontend follows a modular structure that separates:

- API communication
- React Query hooks
- UI components
- Authentication state
- Shared utilities
- TypeScript types

---

## Frontend Architecture

The application uses a layered frontend architecture:

```text
UI Components
      ↓
Custom React Query Hooks
      ↓
API Layer
      ↓
Laravel REST API
```

For real-time features:

```text
Next.js Client
      ↕
Laravel Echo
      ↕
Laravel Reverb
```

For AI post generation:

```text
AI Post Assistant
      ↓
Frontend API Layer
      ↓
Laravel AI Endpoint
      ↓
AI Provider
```

API credentials and AI provider keys are never exposed in the frontend.

## Backend

The frontend communicates with a separate Laravel REST API that handles authentication, application data, real-time events, media storage, stories, messaging, notifications, and AI post generation.

**Backend Repository:**

https://github.com/MohamadJ99/social-media-api

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohamadJ99/Social-Media-App.git
cd Social-Media-App
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/storage
```

Additional environment variables may be required for real-time communication depending on the Laravel Reverb configuration.

### 4. Start the Laravel backend

Make sure the backend API is running before starting the frontend.

The backend repository contains the Laravel setup instructions.
